This project is me redoing my previous project, but using a RTOS.  The previous project https://github.com/TimothyMarchant/IOT-E-Paper-Display, was a bare metal application.  I ported most of the code from it to this project, so there wasn't that many changes.  Using a RTOS would make more sense if this was more than a proof of concept, but I felt like it taught me a lot from using FreeRTOS.
